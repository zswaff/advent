## Introduction
This repo has solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 
online coding problems. It solves all historical problems and will be updated 
to solve new ones as they are released.

The solutions are written for combined development and execution speed (i.e. 
to minimize the total time from when I start reading the problem to when I have 
submitted the correct answer) and are therefore not up to the highest standards 
of excellence stylistically.
